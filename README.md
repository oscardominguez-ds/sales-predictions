Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem

## Recommendations:
I recommend the Linear regression model. The errors or the difference from the true median price vs predicted is smaller than the Decision Tree model.

## Limitations & Next Steps
The graphs show that the smaller stores had more visibility for their products but the medium and larger outlet stores still generate mores sales.
